# ‚ú® Pokemon List App

## Description
This is an iOS application developed in **Swift** using **SwiftUI** and **Concurrency (async/await)**. The app displays a list of Pok√©mon fetched from the Pok√©mon API, allowing users to navigate to their details and mark favorites.

Since no specific design was requested, the UI is functional but does not focus on advanced aesthetics.

## ‚ö° Architecture
The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern to separate responsibilities:

- **Model**: Contains structures representing Pok√©mon data.
- **ViewModel**: Manages business logic and network communication.
- **View**: Handles the UI and connects to the ViewModel using `@StateObject` or `@ObservedObject`.

### Main Components:
1. **Network**: Handles HTTP requests with `URLSession` and `async/await`.
2. **DataInteractor**: Protocol defining network operations.
3. **PokemonListViewModel**: Manages the Pok√©mon list and pagination.
4. **PokemonListView**: Displays the list of Pok√©mon and allows navigation.
5. **PokemonDetailViewModel**: Manages the details of each Pok√©mon.
6. **PokemonDetailView**: Presents detailed information about a selected Pok√©mon.

## üîç Pok√©mon Search
Due to limitations in the Pok√©mon API, **searching does not query the API**, but instead filters the data already loaded on the screen. This means users can only search among the Pok√©mon already retrieved from the API.

## üåê Dependencies
- **SwiftUI** for the UI
- **URLSession** for network calls

## üõ† Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/pokemon-list-app.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode 16 or later.
3. Run the app on a simulator or device.

## üß™ Tests
The application includes **unit tests** using `XCTest`, with tests for:
- API calls using `MockURLProtocol`.
- `PokemonListViewModel` functionality.
- Network error handling.

To run the tests:
```sh
Cmd + U  # Run tests in Xcode
```

## ‚öô Future Improvements
- Implement custom UI designs as per requirements.
- Enhance offline data persistence.
- Integrate API-based search if supported.
